# Phase 6: Procedural Ship Interiors - COMPLETE! üèóÔ∏è

## What Was Built

### 1. Room Generation System (`core/ship/room_system.gd`)
- **9 Room Types**:
  - Helm (Bridge) - Ship control and navigation
  - Engine Room - Propulsion systems
  - Weapons Bay - Weapon control
  - Reactor Core - Power distribution
  - Repair Bay - Bot maintenance
  - Shield Generator - Defensive systems
  - Crew Quarters - Bot charging
  - Cargo Bay - Storage
  - Corridor - Connecting passages

- **Grid-Based Layout**:
  - Rooms placed on a grid (configurable size)
  - Each room has size (e.g., 2x2, 2x1 grid cells)
  - Automatic collision detection (rooms can't overlap)

- **Auto-Connection System**:
  - Automatically finds adjacent rooms
  - Creates doorways between connected rooms
  - Tracks connections for pathfinding

### 2. Ship Generator (`core/ship/ship_generator.gd`)
- **Basic Ship Generator**: Creates predictable layout for testing
  - Helm ‚Üí Reactor ‚Üí Engine (linear layout)
  - Optional weapons bay and repair bay

- **Random Ship Generator**: Procedural variety
  - Always includes required rooms (Helm, Reactor, Engine)
  - Randomly places optional rooms
  - Configurable grid size and room count

### 3. 3D Mesh Generator (`core/ship/room_mesh_generator.gd`)
- **Procedural Geometry**:
  - Floor, ceiling, walls generated for each room
  - Per-room lighting with thematic colors
  - Collision shapes for player physics
  - Doorway placement between connected rooms

- **Size Parameters**:
  - ROOM_CELL_SIZE: 4.0 meters per grid cell
  - ROOM_HEIGHT: 3.0 meters
  - Configurable door size

### 4. Player Bot Controller (`player/player_bot.gd`)
- **FPS Movement**:
  - WASD movement
  - Mouse look (captured when active)
  - Gravity and ground detection

- **Interaction System**:
  - Raycast from camera
  - E key to interact with consoles
  - Mode switching (3D ‚Üî Terminal)

### 5. Helm Console (`player/helm_console.gd`)
- **Interactable Object**:
  - Can be placed in any room
  - Connects to ShipOS
  - Activates terminal UI when player presses E

### 6. Terminal UI (`ui/terminal_ui.gd`)
- **Fullscreen Overlay**:
  - Hides 3D view when active
  - Command input with history
  - Output display

- **ShipOS Integration**:
  - Executes commands through connected console's ShipOS
  - File system access (cat, ls)
  - Help system

### 7. Procedural Ship Scene (`scenes/procedural_ship.gd`)
- **Main Playable Scene**:
  - Generates ship layout on load
  - Creates 3D meshes for all rooms
  - Places consoles in appropriate rooms
  - Spawns player in helm
  - Connects all signals

```

## How to Play

### Open in Godot Editor
```bash
cd ~/SpaceCMD
./Godot_v4.4.1-stable_linux.x86_64 --editor .
```

### Run the Game (F5)
The procedural_ship scene will:
1. Generate a ship layout
2. Create 3D meshes
3. Place consoles
4. Spawn you in the helm

### Controls
- **WASD** - Move around
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **E** - Interact with console (when looking at one)
- **Type commands** - In terminal mode
- **Up/Down arrows** - Command history
- **Escape** - Exit terminal mode

### Try These Commands
```bash
ls /                          # List root directory
ls /dev/ship                  # List ship devices
cat /proc/ship/status         # View ship status
cat /proc/ship/sensors        # View sensors
cat /proc/ship/weapons        # View weapons
help                          # Show help
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Dual-Mode Design
- **3D Mode**: Walk around ship interior
- **Terminal Mode**: Fullscreen command interface
- **Both access the same ShipOS** - graphics are just a view

### Procedural Everything
- Rooms generated at runtime
- 3D meshes created programmatically
- No pre-built ship models needed
- Easy to add new room types

### Headless Still Works
- All 145 tests still pass
- ShipOS works without graphics
- Can play entirely from terminal (future feature)

### Console-Specific Systems
Each console can control different ship systems:
- **Helm Console** ‚Üí Navigation, sensors, targeting
- **Engine Console** ‚Üí Propulsion, FTL (future)
- **Weapons Console** ‚Üí Fire control (future)
- **Reactor Console** ‚Üí Power distribution (future)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Enhancements
1. **External Ship View** - Camera outside ship showing 3D combat
2. **Physical Weapons** - 3D models on exterior that fire projectiles
3. **Better Doorways** - Sliding doors, frames, airlocks
4. **Viewport Textures** - Show terminal on console screen in 3D

### Future Features
1. **Multi-Ship Boarding** - Walk from your ship to enemy ship
2. **Ship Damage** - Rooms can be destroyed, fire, hull breaches
3. **Crew Bots** - Other bots walking around doing tasks
4. **Hacking Animations** - Visual effects when hacking systems

## Technical Notes

### Type Safety
- Used `var ship_os = null` instead of `@export var ship_os: ShipOS`
- ShipOS can't be exported (not a Resource/Node)
- Used `get()` for safe member access

### Grid System
- Simple 2D grid for room placement
- Each cell = 4 meters in 3D space
- Easy to expand/modify

### Console Placement
- Automatically placed in room centers
- One console per room (for rooms that need them)
- Connected to shared ShipOS instance

## What Makes This Special

‚úÖ **Procedural Generation** - Infinite ship variety
‚úÖ **Terminal-First** - Command line is core gameplay
‚úÖ **Dual-Mode** - Walk around OR use terminal
‚úÖ **Headless Compatible** - Can run without graphics
‚úÖ **Scriptable** - Add new room types easily
‚úÖ **Modular** - Each room type has specific purpose
‚úÖ **Scalable** - Grid system supports any size ship

**Status**: Phase 6 Complete - You can now walk around a procedurally generated ship interior and access the command line through consoles! üéâ
