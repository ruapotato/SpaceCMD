# SpaceCMD - Godot Edition

**Hackers meet FTL in 3D space**

A roguelike spaceship game where every ship is a real computer running an OS, and you hack enemies with actual PooScript code - now in full 3D!

## 🎮 Core Concept

You are a **robot crew member** on a spaceship. Every ship (yours and enemies) runs a real operating system with:
- **Unix-like filesystem** (VFS with device files)
- **PooScript processes** (enemy AI, automation scripts)
- **Full OS emulation** per ship (isolated instances)

### Attack Vectors

1. **Physical Boarding** 🤖
   - Walk through your ship in 3D
   - Dock at enemy airlock
   - Fight through their ship
   - Reach their helm terminal
   - Access their OS directly → kill AI processes

2. **Network Exploit** 🔫
   - Purchase exploit (costs scrap)
   - Get within laser range (5-10 units)
   - Fire exploit laser
   - Gain temporary SSH access
   - **Connection lost if you fly too far!**

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE TODO

### ✅ Phase 6: Procedural Ship Interiors & Bot Control COMPLETE!

**Status:** Player can now walk around procedurally generated ship interiors!

**What's Done:**
- ✅ **Procedural Room Generation System**
  - Room types: Helm, Engine, Weapons, Reactor, Repair Bay, Shields, Crew Quarters, Cargo
  - Grid-based layout generator
  - Automatic room connections and doorways
  - Configurable ship sizes (basic or random layouts)

- ✅ **3D Room Mesh Generator**
  - Procedural geometry for rooms (floors, ceilings, walls)
  - Per-room lighting with thematic colors
  - Collision detection for floors/walls
  - Doorway placement between connected rooms

- ✅ **Player Bot (First-Person Controller)**
  - FPS movement (WASD)
  - Mouse look camera
  - Interaction system (raycast + E key)
  - Mode switching (3D ↔ Terminal)

- ✅ **Room-Specific Consoles**
  - Helm Console - ship control and navigation
  - Engine Console - propulsion systems
  - Weapons Console - weapon control
  - Reactor Console - power distribution
  - Each console connects to ShipOS

- ✅ **Terminal UI System**
  - Fullscreen terminal overlay (press E on console)
  - Command execution through ShipOS
  - Command history (arrow keys)
  - File system access (cat, ls)
  - Press Escape to return to 3D view

**What This Means:**
- 🎉 Players control a **bot** that walks around the ship
- 🎉 Ships are **procedurally generated** with interconnected rooms
- 🎉 **Dual-mode gameplay**: Walk around in 3D OR use terminal to hack/control
- 🎉 **Headless mode still works** - all tests pass, terminal-only gameplay possible
- 🎉 Ready to add **external 3D combat view** while maintaining interior gameplay

**Next Steps:**
- Add external ship view (3D combat while flying)
- Add physical weapon models that fire projectiles
- Add exterior camera toggle
- Improve doorway visuals (sliding doors, frames)
- Add viewport texture to show terminal on console screen

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd ~/SpaceCMD

# Core systems (VFS, PooScript, Kernel)
./Godot_v4.4.1-stable_linux.x86_64 --headless --script tests/test_core_systems.gd

# ShipOS integration (device bridge, sensors, weapons)
./Godot_v4.4.1-stable_linux.x86_64 --headless --script tests/test_ship_os.gd

# Hostile AI (autonomous targeting and firing)
./Godot_v4.4.1-stable_linux.x86_64 --headless --script tests/test_hostile_ai.gd

# Combat Manager (multi-ship battles, projectiles, damage)
./Godot_v4.4.1-stable_linux.x86_64 --headless --script tests/test_combat_simple.gd
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ VFS operations (mkdir, create, read, write, devices)
- ✅ PooScript execution (spawn, kill, ps)
- ✅ Kernel syscalls (open, read, write, close)
- ✅ ShipOS device bridge (16 device files)
- ✅ Sensor system (nearby ships, targeting)
- ✅ Weapon firing integration
- ✅ Hostile AI (scans, targets, fires)
- ✅ Combat orchestration (projectiles, collisions, damage)
- ✅ Victory/defeat conditions

### Quick Demo
```gdscript
# Create ships
var player = Ship.new("USS Enterprise", "Cruiser")
player.position = Vector3(0, 0, 0)
player.os = ShipOS.new(player)

var enemy = Ship.new("Pirate", "Scout")
enemy.position = Vector3(500, 0, 0)
enemy.os = ShipOS.new(enemy)

# Add weapon
var laser = Weapon.new("Burst Laser")
laser.damage = 10.0
laser.charge = 1.0
enemy.weapons.append(laser)

# Register with CombatManager
CombatManager.add_ship(player, "player")
CombatManager.add_ship(enemy, "enemy")
player.os.combat_manager = CombatManager
enemy.os.combat_manager = CombatManager

# Start battle
CombatManager.start_battle()

# Spawn hostile AI
var ai = FileAccess.get_file_as_string("res://scripts/ai/hostile.poo")
enemy.os.vfs.create_file("/bin/hostile.poo", 0x1ED, 0, 0, ai.to_utf8_buffer())
var pid = enemy.os.execute_command("/bin/hostile.poo")

# AI automatically:
# 1. Scans /proc/ship/sensors
# 2. Writes /dev/ship/target
# 3. Fires weapon via /dev/ship/actions/fire
# 4. CombatManager spawns projectile
# 5. Projectile travels and hits player
# 6. Damage applied (shields → hull)

# Player can hack:
enemy.os.kill_process(pid)  # AI disabled!
```

## 🎯 Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. PooScript = GDScript
**Decision**: Use GDScript itself as PooScript execution engine

**Why**:
- No need to write Python interpreter in GDScript
- Dynamic script loading/execution built-in
- Full Godot integration
- Still wraps scripts in process isolation

**How**:
```gdscript
# Enemy AI writes a PooScript
var ai_code = """
while true:
    # Fire weapons
    var fd = kernel.sys_open(pid, "/dev/ship/fire", O_WRONLY)
    kernel.sys_write(fd, b"0")
    sleep(1.0)
"""

# PooScript wraps it and executes
var script = GDScript.new()
script.source_code = wrap_as_process(ai_code, pid)
script.reload()
var obj = script.new()
obj.main()  # Runs in background
```

### 2. One OS Instance Per Ship
**Decision**: Each ship gets isolated ShipOS

**Why**:
- True isolation (no shared state bugs)
- Can hack into enemy OS
- Player can board and access different OS
- Different ships can run different AI

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
var player_ship_os = ShipOS.new(player_ship)  # VFS #1
var enemy_ship_os = ShipOS.new(enemy_ship)    # VFS #2

# Completely isolated!
```

### 3. Device Files Bridge Reality
**Decision**: Ship state syncs through device files

**Why**:
- Unix philosophy ("everything is a file")
- PooScript can read/write devices
- GDScript reads devices to render world
- Clean separation of concerns

**Flow**:
```
Enemy AI (PooScript)
  ↓ write("/dev/ship/fire", "0")
Device Handler
  ↓ callback
GDScript
  ↓ fire_weapon_3d(0)
3D World (projectile spawns)
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Vision

1. **Start**: You're a bot on your ship. Walk to helm.
2. **Flight**: Access terminal, enter flight mode (3D space).
3. **Encounter**: Enemy ship appears (running hostile.poo AI).
4. **Combat**: Traditional dogfight OR...
5. **Hack**: Buy exploit, fire laser, SSH into enemy OS.
6. **Disable**: `ps aux` → `kill 42` → enemy AI dies.
7. **Board**: Dock, enter their ship, reach helm, take full control.
8. **Control**: Upload friendly.poo, enemy joins your fleet!

## 🔥 What Makes This Special

- ✅ **Real OS per ship** - Not fake, actual VFS with processes
- ✅ **Hackable AI** - Kill enemy processes to disable AI
- ✅ **Physical boarding** - Walk through ships in 3D
- ✅ **Scriptable** - Add your own AI/automation
- ✅ **Two attack vectors** - Network exploits OR physical boarding
- ✅ **Range-based hacking** - Maintain connection or lose access
- ✅ **Fully moddable** - Add new AI scripts easily
