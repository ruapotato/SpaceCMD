### 5. Sensor & Targeting System ✅
**Enhancements to ShipOS:**

- ✅ `nearby_ships` array - Populated by combat manager
- ✅ `current_target` tracking
- ✅ Sensor device lists all nearby ships with:
  - Distance calculation
  - Bearing (+/-)
  - Hull status
  - Target marking
- ✅ Target device allows:
  - Reading current target info
  - Writing to acquire/clear target
  - Ship name lookup in sensor range

### 6. Hostile AI Implementation ✅
**File**: `scripts/ai/hostile.poo` (~115 lines)

**Full autonomous enemy AI that:**
- ✅ Scans `/proc/ship/sensors` for contacts
- ✅ Acquires target via `/dev/ship/target`
- ✅ Checks target distance
- ✅ Verifies weapon range (10 units)
- ✅ Reads `/proc/ship/weapons` status
- ✅ Fires weapons via `/dev/ship/actions/fire`
- ✅ Fully functional combat loop

**Test Results:**
```
[HOSTILE AI] No target - scanning...
[HOSTILE AI] Acquiring target: USS Enterprise
[ShipOS] Target acquired: USS Enterprise
[HOSTILE AI] Target distance: 5.0 units
[HOSTILE AI] Target in range - checking weapons...
[HOSTILE AI] Firing weapon 0!
[ShipOS] Fired weapon 0: Burst Laser
✅ Weapon charge: 100% → 0% (CONFIRMED FIRED)
```

## 🎮 Current Capabilities

### What Works Right Now:
1. ✅ Create ships with ShipOS instances
2. ✅ Spawn hostile AI that autonomously fights
3. ✅ AI detects targets via sensors
4. ✅ AI fires weapons at targets in range
5. ✅ Full Unix-like OS per ship
6. ✅ Device file bridge (OS ↔ ship state)
7. ✅ Kill enemy AI processes
8. ✅ Upload custom AI scripts

### Example Usage:
```gdscript
# Create player and enemy ships
var player_ship = Ship.new("USS Enterprise", "Kestrel")
var enemy_ship = Ship.new("Pirate Cruiser", "Rebel")

# Give enemy a weapon
var laser = Weapon.new("Burst Laser")
laser.charge = 1.0
enemy_ship.weapons.append(laser)

# Create OS instances
var player_os = ShipOS.new(player_ship)
var enemy_os = ShipOS.new(enemy_ship)

# Set up sensors (combat manager would do this)
player_os.nearby_ships = [player_ship, enemy_ship]
enemy_os.nearby_ships = [player_ship, enemy_ship]

# Load and spawn hostile AI
var hostile_script = FileAccess.get_file_as_string("res://scripts/ai/hostile.poo")
enemy_os.vfs.create_file("/bin/hostile.poo", 0x1ED, 0, 0, hostile_script.to_utf8_buffer())
var ai_pid = enemy_os.execute_command("/bin/hostile.poo")

# AI now autonomously:
# 1. Scans sensors
# 2. Acquires player as target
# 3. Checks range
# 4. Fires weapons

# Player can hack and kill AI:
enemy_os.kill_process(ai_pid)  # Enemy ship disabled!
```
