# Fixes Applied

## Issue: "Fail to fire weapon not ready or unavailable"

### Root Causes Found:
1. **Sound Effects Crash** - Game was crashing on startup due to WeaponType enum bug
2. **Starting Weapon Not Charged** - Weapon started at 0.0 charge, taking 12 seconds to charge

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Fixed Sound Effects Enum Bug (core/combat.py:117)
**Problem:** Trying to call `.lower()` on WeaponType enum instead of its string value
```python
# BEFORE (crashed):
if "missile" in weapon.weapon_type.lower():

# AFTER (fixed):
weapon_type_str = weapon.weapon_type.value  # Get enum value as string
if "missile" in weapon_type_str:
```

#### 2. Pre-charge Starting Weapon (core/ships.py:122)
**Problem:** Burst Laser II started with `charge = 0.0`, requiring 12 seconds to charge before first shot
```python
# BEFORE:
burst_laser = create_weapon("burst_laser_ii")
ship.add_weapon(burst_laser)

# AFTER (fixed):
burst_laser = create_weapon("burst_laser_ii")
burst_laser.charge = 1.0  # Start fully charged and ready to fire!
ship.add_weapon(burst_laser)
```

## Testing Results

### Automated Tests:
âœ… Weapon charge test - PASSED (weapon starts at 1.0 charge)
âœ… Fire command test - PASSED (exit code 0, weapon fires successfully)
âœ… Game startup test - PASSED (no crashes)

### Test Output:
```
Weapon 1: Burst Laser II
  Charge: 1.0 / 1.0
  Ready to fire: YES âœ“

Fire command result:
  Exit code: 0
  Stdout: âš¡ Firing weapon 1 at Core!
```

## How to Use:

1. **Start the game:**
   ```bash
   python3 play.py --ship kestrel
   ```

2. **Wait for combat** (auto-triggers on startup)

3. **Check your weapons:**
   ```bash
   weapons
   ```
   Should show: `[READY]`

4. **Target enemy system:**
   ```bash
   enemy              # List enemy systems
   target "Weapon Pod"  # Or whatever system you want to hit
   ```

5. **Fire weapon:**
   ```bash
   fire 1             # Should work immediately!
   ```

## What Should Happen:
- âš¡ Weapon fires immediately (no waiting for charge)
- ðŸ’¥ Damage is dealt to enemy
- Sound effects play (laser fire, shield/hull hits)
- Weapon starts recharging for next shot

## If Still Not Working:

Check these requirements:
1. **In combat?** - Type `cat /proc/ship/combat` to verify
2. **Target set?** - Type `cat /dev/ship/target` to see current target
3. **Weapons system functional?** - Type `cat /sys/ship/systems/weapons/health`
4. **Weapon charged?** - Type `weapons` to see charge status

## Files Modified:
- `core/combat.py` - Fixed WeaponType enum bug (line 117)
- `core/ships.py` - Pre-charge starting weapon (line 122)

All fixes tested and working!
