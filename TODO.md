## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can play a complete run from sector 1 to final boss

- [ ] Beautiful ASCII ship visualization
- [ ] Fully scriptable via PooScript
- [ ] Procedural replayability
- [ ] At least 3 unlockable ships
- [ ] 30+ events
- [ ] 20+ weapons
- [ ] Save/load functionality

## Questions to Resolve

- Real-time vs turn-based combat? (Suggest: Real-time with pause)
- How much RNG vs skill? (Suggest: FTL-like balance)
- Permadeath always or optional? (Suggest: Always, true roguelike)
- Terminal size requirements? (Suggest: 80x24 minimum, 120x40 recommended)
- Color requirement? (Suggest: Optional, works in monochrome)
- Mouse support? (Suggest: No, keyboard only for true CLI feel)
