# New Features Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Ship Info System
**What:** Comprehensive ship statistics display
- **Files Created:**
  - `/proc/ship_info` - Virtual file showing detailed ship stats
  - `scripts/bin/shipinfo` - Command to view ship info
  - `core/gui/ship_info_widget.py` - GUI app for ship info

**Features:**
- Shield recharge rate calculation with breakdown (Health × Power × Crew bonus)
- All system effectiveness ratings
- Power allocation details
- Resources (Dark Matter, Missiles, Scrap)
- Crew status and locations
- Weapon status with charge bars
- Scrollable interface with mouse wheel support

**How to Use:**
- Command line: `shipinfo`
- GUI: Press `Ctrl+I` or select "Ship Info" from APPS menu
- Shows real-time data updated from ship state

### 2. Dark Matter Fuel System
**What:** Renamed fuel to "Dark Matter" throughout codebase
- Changed variable name: `ship.fuel` → `ship.dark_matter`
- Updated all display strings
- Updated device files: `/dev/ship/dark_matter`
- Maintains balance: jump costs, resource display

**Why:** More sci-fi themed, fits game aesthetic better

### 3. Galaxy Map Zoom & Navigation
**What:** Enhanced galaxy map with zoom and pan controls

**Features:**
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom:** Zoom in/out (0.5x to 2.0x)
- **Middle-Mouse Drag:** Pan around the map
- **Zoom-to-cursor:** Map zooms toward mouse position
- **Zoom indicator:** Shows current zoom level in bottom-right
- **Smooth auto-scroll:** Keeps current sector visible

**Controls:**
- Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
- Middle mouse + drag: Pan map
- Left click: Jump to node (as before)

**UI Updates:**
- Added zoom level display: "Zoom: 1.0x"
- Updated hints: "Mouse wheel zoom • Middle-drag pan"

### 4. Shield Recharge System
**What:** Shields now regenerate automatically

**How it Works:**
- Recharge rate = Shield System Effectiveness
- Effectiveness = Health × Power Ratio × (1 + Crew Bonus)
- Shows in ship info: "Shield Recharge: X.XX /sec"
- Example: 100% health × 66% power × 110% crew = 0.73 shields/sec

**Factors:**
- System health: Damaged systems recharge slower
- Power allocation: More power = faster recharge
- Crew skill: Each shield skill level = +10% bonus

- `Ctrl+T` - New Terminal
- `Ctrl+D` - Tactical Display

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Shield Recharge Implementation
Located in `core/ship.py`, `update()` method:
```python
if SystemType.SHIELDS in self.systems:
    shields_system = self.systems[SystemType.SHIELDS]
    if shields_system.is_online():
        # Shields recharge when not taking damage
        self.shields = min(self.shields_max,
                          self.shields + dt * shields_system.get_effectiveness())
```

### Zoom Implementation
Located in `core/gui/map_widget_v2.py`:
- Properties scale visual settings based on zoom level
- Mouse wheel adjusts zoom factor (0.1 per tick)
- Scroll position adjusted to zoom toward cursor
- Min zoom: 0.5x, Max zoom: 2.0x

### Dark Matter Conversion
- Global find/replace: `.fuel` → `.dark_matter`
- Display strings: "Fuel" → "Dark Matter"
- Jump cost: 1 dark matter per jump
- Initial amounts adjusted (player: 20, enemies: 0)
